					Sweet Eats Bakery. This webpage shows an understanding of and use of basic HTML and CSS markup. This
					project can be found by clicking teh following Sweet Eats Bakery link. <a

				<p>The second project i have completed was to design the Great Idea website. This webpage shows an
					understanding and use of advanced CSS such as using flex box and incorporates the practice of
					semantic HTML. This project can be found on Github at the following link. <a

						alt="Image of desert" /></span>
				<p>I am originally from El Paso, Texas however i moved to Concord, North Carolina in the fall of 2010. I
					graduated hishschool early in the spring of 2011 and joined the US Army. After the Army i decided
					that i wanted to get back into an early passion of mine which was information Technology. I got a
					job with a small medical company that did Polysomnograohy and Electroencephalogram commonly known as
					EEG studies. I worked for this company for 5 years as a Tech Support Analyst before moving into a
					network engineer role. I now work for one of the large fincancial institutions as a Technical
					Support Analyst while I am currently pursuing a Bachelors degree in Software Development with a
					major in Java and C# languages. I am alos attending Lambda School part time to gain expierence and
					learn the role of a Full Stack Web Developer which is the role i would be most happy to see myself
					in throughout my career.</p>
